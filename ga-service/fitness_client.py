-----------------
Talks to the fitness POOL. The pool is reached through a single DNS name
("fitness-pool"); Docker's embedded DNS round-robins each new connection
to a different worker replica.

To actually USE multiple workers in parallel, we split the population into
chunks and fire the requests concurrently with a thread pool. With N
workers and N chunks, the workers process in parallel — so adding workers
reduces wall-clock evaluation time. This is the throughput benefit the
scaling experiment measures.
