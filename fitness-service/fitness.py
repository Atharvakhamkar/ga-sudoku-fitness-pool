fitness.py  (SUDOKU)
--------------------
The fitness function, identical in every worker replica and completely
stateless. It scores a COMPLETE 9x9 Sudoku grid (sent as a flat list of 81
integers) by counting how many of its column and box units are internally
valid.

Encoding contract (enforced by the GA side, not here):
  * Every ROW is already a permutation of 1..9, so rows are always valid.
  * Therefore the GA only has to fix COLUMNS and BOXES.

Score = (distinct digits in each column) + (distinct digits in each box)
      summed over 9 columns + 9 boxes.
  * Each unit contributes 0..9 (9 = all digits present exactly once).
  * MAX_SCORE = 18 units * 9 = 162  -> a solved Sudoku.
Higher is better, so this plugs straight into the existing maximising GA.
