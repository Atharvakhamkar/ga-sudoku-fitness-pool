main.py (scaler)
----------------
The autoscaler. This is the component that implements your professor's rule:

   "maintain the rate of increase of fitness value; if the fitness value
    is not increasing, add more fitness workers."

How it works:
  1. Polls /results/status.json (written by the GA every generation).
  2. Reads the improvement_rate and the per-generation wall time.
  3. Decides scale_up / scale_down / no_change.
  4. Adds or removes fitness worker CONTAINERS via the Docker SDK,
     attaching each new worker to the network with the alias "fitness-pool"
     so Docker DNS round-robins to it automatically.

It never touches the baseline worker started by docker-compose, so the
pool can never drop below 1.

Scaling logic
-------------
  - Stagnating (rate below threshold) AND generations are slow
        -> scale UP: more throughput lets the GA evaluate the population
           faster, so it can run more generations / a bigger population in
           the same wall-clock budget -> more chances to escape the plateau.
  - Improving healthily AND pool under-used
        -> scale DOWN: stop paying for workers we don't need.

Important honesty note (put this in your report):
  Adding identical workers does NOT change the fitness LANDSCAPE, so it does
  not *directly* raise the ceiling. It raises THROUGHPUT. The experiment
  measures whether that extra throughput, converted into more evaluations,
  indirectly improves convergence speed and final quality.
